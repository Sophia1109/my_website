Before joining LBS, I studied at the lyceum #82 in Nizhny Novgorod with specialisation in Maths and Physics. After finishing the schools and passing "A-levels", I studied at Higher School of Economics in a double-degree programme with University of London, specialising in Economics and Finance. 4 years of hard work allowed me to graduate with a First Class Honours diploma.
